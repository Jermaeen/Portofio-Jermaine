    <h1>High Velocity Bullet Casing Simulation</h1>
    <p class="lead" style="line-height: 1.5;">The process behind this project included modeling the wall as a rigid body and fixed in space. 
      Also included is modeling the bilinear isotropic hardening plasticity material of the bullet using mechanical properties 
      provided by the Engineering Data in Ansys. An explicit dynamics simulation was performed to capture the high-speed impact 
      and resulting plastic deformation of the bullet. The goal was to analyze the mesh plot, velocity and constraint plots, total 
      Deformation, equivalent stress, equivalent plastic strain, and user-defined result of effective strain of the bullet material upon impact. 
      This provides insight into the material’s performance under extreme conditions.

            The process behind this project included providing the velocity magnitude and direction for the bullet along with 
            modeling the wall as a rigid body and fixed in space. 
            Also included is modeling the bilinear isotropic hardening plasticity material of the bullet using mechanical properties 
            provided by the Engineering Data in Ansys. An explicit dynamics simulation was performed to capture the high-speed impact 
            and resulting plastic deformation of the bullet. The goal was to analyze the mesh plot, velocity and constraint plots, total 
            deformation, equivalent stress, equivalent plastic strain, and user-defined result of effective strain of the bullet material upon impact. 
            This provides insight into the material’s performance under extreme conditions.

          <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Results</strong> <br>
          The results of this simulation provided insight into the material’s performance under extreme conditions. 
          From the images above, you can see the mesh plot, velocity and constraint plots, total deformation, equivalent stress, equivalent plastic strain, and user-defined result of effective strain of the bullet.
          With each displaying the different areas of stress and strain that the bullet undergoes upon impact. As expected the hightest amount of total deformation and stress occurs at the tip of the bullet where it makes contact with the rigid wall.
          Associated with the area of high deformation is the highest amount of equivalent von-mises stress which indicates that the material has yielded and undergone plastic deformation.
          This is further represnted in the next image which shows the equivalent plastic strain of the bullet. The user-defined result of effective strain also shows the same trend with the highest amount of effective strain occurring at the tip of the bullet.
