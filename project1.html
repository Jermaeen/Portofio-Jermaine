    <h1>Portable Coffee Maker</h1>
    <p class="lead" style="line-height: 1.5;">The project addressed the limitations of conventional coffee makers by developing a portable, 
      battery-powered unit capable of attaching to most mugs, cups, and thermoses while efficiently heating and brewing coffee on the go. 
      The approach involved creating detailed CAD models in SolidWorks, conducting structural FEA in ANSYS, 
      and iteratively refining the design to resolve heating inconsistencies, battery drain, and leakage through insulation upgrades, 
      heating element optimization, and improved sealing. The final prototype successfully brewed 240 ml of coffee in 2 minutes 45 seconds,
      maintained 93 °C ± 2 °C for 10 minutes, and passed a 3 ft drop test without leaks or damage.

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Challenges & Solutions</strong>  <br>
        During development, the prototype faced several issues. The heating was either inconsistent or insufficient, leading to suboptimal brewing. 
        The battery life also proved to be a limitation, as it drained quickly under normal operation. Additionally, early versions of the design 
        experienced leakage at the joints, which raised both performance and safety concerns. To address these challenges, the team added double-walled 
        insulation and redesigned the heating element layout to provide more consistent and adequate heating. Battery performance was improved by 
        optimizing the PWM heating system and insulating the internal piping to reduce heat loss. Leakage was resolved by switching to food-safe silicone 
        gaskets and refining the fastener layout, ensuring a secure, durable seal.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Results</strong> <br>
        The final prototype successfully brewed 240 ml of coffee in 2 minutes and 45 seconds, meeting the desired speed and efficiency targets. 
        Temperature stability was maintained at 93 °C ± 2 °C for a full 10 minutes, ensuring optimal flavor extraction and heat retention for the beverage.
        In durability testing, the unit passed a 3-foot drop test without any leaks or structural damage, confirming that the improvements to sealing and assembly design were effective. 
        These results validated the design changes, demonstrating that the product met both performance and reliability goals. </p>

      <h2>Role & Timeline</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> My role in this project involved being the primary CAD and supplementary FEA Engineer. Specifically, this meant creating the detailed CAD models in SolidWorks, 
        assisting in conducting structural FEA on the design using ANSYS and participating in prototype testing and data collection.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
        The project was completed over a 4-month period, with the initial design phase taking 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of FEA analysis and optimization, 
        and concluding with 6 weeks of prototyping and testing. This timeline allowed for iterative improvements based on testing feedback, ensuring that the final product met all performance criteria.
